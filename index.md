## Variables

Give a name to a space in memory.

```
variable_Name = value;

a = 10;
name = "Steve Jobs"
```

## Constants

Unchangeable data in the program.

```
To work around this, you use all capital letters to name a variable to indicate that the variable 
should be treated as a constant. For example:

Defining constant_name value;
 
# DAY = 7
```

## Keywords

Python keywords reserved and not available for re-definition or overloading.

## Data_Types

A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. 

#### 1. Integer

Python int variable requires minimum 24 bytes on 32-bit / 64-bit system.
It may vary as per hardware.
```
import sys
sys.getsizeof( int() ) # prints 24
sys.getsizeof(0) # prints 24
sys.getsizeof(1) # prints 28
sys.getsizeof(-2) # prints 28
```
It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later
in the program. 

Represent integers like 1, 10.
```
number = 10
```

#### 2. Floating point

Python int variable requires minimum 24 bytes on 32-bit / 64-bit system.
It may vary as per hardware.
```
import sys
sys.getsizeof( float() ) # prints 24
sys.getsizeof(0.0) # prints 24
```

Represent decimals like 1.23, -2.332.
```
number = 1.23
```

#### 3. String

```
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a)
```

#### 5. Boolean

Represent True and False.

```
import sys
sys.getsizeof( bool() ) # prints 24
sys.getsizeof(True) # prints 28
sys.getsizeof(False) # prints 24
```

```
print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
```

```
+ - * / % ++ -- += >= || ! && ...
```

```
pre-increment/decrement: a=2; b=++a; // Do b=a first and ++a, the result is a=3; b=3;
```

```
post-increment/decrement: a=2; b=a++; // Do a++ first and b=a, the result is a=3; b=2;
```

## Program_Control_Flow

#### 1. Selection statements

If condition:
```
a = 10
b = 5
if b > a:
  ...
elif a == b:
  ...
else:
  ...
```

Conditional Operator ?:
```
c = a > b ? a : b; // a > b is true then return a, false return b.
```

Switch condition:
```
Python does not have this. 
So, to get around this, we use Pythonâ€™s built-in dictionary construct to implement cases and decided what to do when a case is met. 
We can also specify what to do when none is met.
```

#### 2. Iteration statements

While loop:
```
# expression can be any condition

while expression:
  statement
 } 
```

## Array

Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:
```
x = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
```

#### 1. What is an Array

An array is a special variable, they can hold more than one value at a time.
```
x1 = "A"
x2 = "B"
x3 = "C"
x4 = "D"
```

#### 2. Accessing the elements of an Array.
```
x1 = x[0]
```

#### 3. Get the length of the array.
```
x1 = len(x)
```

#### 4. Looping Array Elements.
```
for x1 in x:
  print(x1)
```

#### 5. Adding Array Elements.
```
x.append("E")
```

#### 5. Removing Array Elements.

pop() method to remove an element from the array.
```
x.pop(1)
```

remove() method to remove an element from the array.
```
x.remove("A")
```

#### 6. Array Methods.

Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists/arrays.
```
append()  -> Adds an element at the end of the list.
clear()   -> Removes all the elements from the list
copy()    ->	Returns a copy of the list.
count()   -> Returns the number of elements with the specified value.
extend()  -> Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list.
index()   -> Returns the index of the first element with the specified value.
insert()  -> Adds an element at the specified position.
pop()     -> Removes the element at the specified position.
remove()  -> Removes the first item with the specified value.
reverse() -> Reverses the order of the list.
sort()    -> Sorts the list.
```
